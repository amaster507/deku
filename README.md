# Deku

---

Deku is a [DGraph](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph) query builder ðŸ¦¸ </br>
Compose fluently complex and dynamic DGraph queries & mutation!

This branch is the JavaScript version

---

### Status

The project is currently **ðŸ¦¸ In super early stages ðŸ¦¸**, the API hasn't
stabilised just yet. Many features are still under development.

### Why?

The DGraph query language is awesome! it is really powerful, and you can achieve
a lot with it. However, as you start trying to add dynamicity (like any other
declarative query language) you soon starts fiddling with a lot strings
concatenations and can quickly get messy.

Deku tries to simplify the construction of DGraph Queries and mutations with a
fluent API.
